This directory used to be totally fractured from the rest of the tripwire file
tree. As a result, there's still some of duplication.

It's not safe to blindly remove duplicate entries-- ensure that it's not still
in use before remoing it (although the mailserver is the only
system at risk of using stuff from this directory).
